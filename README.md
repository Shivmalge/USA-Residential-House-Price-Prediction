#### Let's see one by one how they will impact on house prices.

### 1. Demand and Supply:
                        The housing market is subject to the same economic laws of supply and demand as every other industry. 
      When there are more buyers than sellers, the supply of houses goes down and the demand goes up, making houses harder to 
      buy and more expensive. It's not just the amount of houses available, but also how much money is available to buy them.
      It is rare for a new homeowner to plunk down cash when buying a home. Instead, buyers use debt in the form of a mortgage.
      As long as banks are willing to keep lending, sellers can ask high prices for their homes and get them. When banks start
      lending less, however, the price of the house will come down or it will sit on the market.

### 2. The Economy:
                  If the economy is going strong and unemployment goes down, housing prices could rise. In a strong economy, 
      people feel more secure in their jobs and their ability to take on mortgage debt. They're also more likely to get 
      approved for that mortgage. If the economy falls, however, more people find themselves laid off, having to live on 
      unemployment compensation or accept much lower paying jobs. If this problem arises fewer people are able to purchase 
      houses, competition for them goes away and motivated sellers must lower their asking price to get a sale. So due to this
      house price would go down.
