# USA-Residential-House-Price-Prediction

## This case study is about to predict the features that will affect the  residential house prices in USA.  

The features that will affect the price of residential houses in USA in next 10 years are likely to depends on many areas.
Over the time, the price of houses fluctuates. If I want to buy a house, understanding what makes prices go up helps me know when and where I get the best price for a house. When I sell or buy the house, the condition and size of the house both play a factor in the listing price. House price is also depends on the right economic and political conditions of the USA or that particular area.

## There could be some important factors that will affect the prices of houses very impactfully.
- Demand and Supply
- The Economy
- Interest Rates
- Political Forces
- Bay Area Boom
- Area Desirability

#### Let's see one by one how they will impact on house prices.

### 1. Demand and Supply:
                 The housing market is subject to the same economic laws of supply and demand as every other industry. 
      When there are more buyers than sellers, the supply of houses goes down and the demand goes up, making houses harder to 
      buy and more expensive. It's not just the amount of houses available, but also how much money is available to buy them.
      It is rare for a new homeowner to plunk down cash when buying a home. Instead, buyers use debt in the form of a mortgage.
      As long as banks are willing to keep lending, sellers can ask high prices for their homes and get them. When banks start
      lending less, however, the price of the house will come down or it will sit on the market.

### 2. The Economy:
                   If the economy is going strong and unemployment goes down, housing prices could rise. In a strong
      economy, people feel more secure in their jobs and their ability to take on mortgage debt. They're also more likely 
      to get approved for that mortgage. If the economy falls, however, more people find themselves laid off, having to 
      live on unemployment compensation or accept much lower paying jobs. If this problem arises fewer people are able to 
      purchase houses, competition for them goes away and sellers must lower their asking price to get a sale. So due to 
      this house price would go down. So Economy impacts the houses prices as per the unemployement rate. 
      
### 3. Interest Rates:
                    Changes in interest rates can also impact housing prices. If interest rate is low, home prices tend to 
      be high. There could be One reason for that and it is such that low interest rates encourage buyers, and the more buyers
      there are, there would be more competetion for purchasing houses. A lower interest rate lets us borrow more without 
      seeing a huge jump in our monthly mortgage payment. If the interest rate will goes up, however, so does our monthly 
      mortgage payment. If interest rates rise, houses become less affordable unless their prices come down.

### 4. Political Forces:
                     The national and local political climate also impacts housing prices. One big way is through tariffs.
      Some of the materials required to build new homes get imported to the U.S. from other countries. If, for example, heavy
      tariffs get imposed on foreign steel or lumber, the cost of building new homes increases. Tax laws also impact housing 
      prices. As of 2018, homeowners can still deduct mortgage interest on loans of up to $750,000. If that were to change 
      in the future, however, fewer people may have an incentive to buy, and home prices may go down. If more tax breaks are
      created for homeowners, ownership may rise and take home prices along with it. 
                     Local political issues, too, can impact housing prices. San Francisco, for example, has a very specific 
      vibe that many of its citizens want to protect. One way they do so is by limiting the number and type of new homes that
      builders may construct in certain parts of the city. As a result, the growing city is in a high demand for housing. 
      The result hasbeen a drastic demand for housing with limited supply that has driven housing costs sky high. 
      
      
### 5. Bay Area Boom:
                    Even with home prices rising across the nation between May of 2012 and 2018, the Bay Area has seen a much
      higher rise than average. In 2018, the median sale price of homes in San Francisco reached $1.6 million. Prices have 
      also climbed due to an influx of wealth into the city. 
                      
      
### 6. Area Desirability:
                    While housing prices tend to rise and fall on a national level, you may live in a micro-climate that
       defies the norm. Even though if housing prices fall across the nation, prices in some diffenent location across the 
       country  may rise. This occurs due to desirability.If someone is living in an excellent school district or trendy area
       where people want to be, the price of houses in your area will likely go up. If a new manufacturing plant or large company 
       brings jobs to a particular area, people may flock to the region, even if the population was small before.  If new 
       housing isn't built fast enough to accommodate the influx of people, housing pries in the area will rise. Even if the 
       supply of housing does keep pace with the demand, home's value may increase simply because people want to be where we are 
       living in good area.
      
      
       There could be some other factors in desirability that could affects the price and these are:
       1. Average Income of Area
       2. Average Area House Age
       3. House contains Number of Rooms
       4. Number of Bedrooms in house
       5. Area Population

## By considering above five features and with one previous dataset of USA house price of particular areas, I have created one machine learning model in which I have predicted the House prices.

## I have Imported all the required libraries and read the dataset using pandas.

## I have described and analyzed the dataset.
